####Starting
1. check if we have the same ruby version `ruby -v`
2. `yarn install --check-files`
3. `bundle install`
4. `rake db:migrate`
5. `rails db:populate_populate_data`

#### Things that I did
1. I start a new project all over because i thought it was messy and needed to start from the bottom while keeping most of the DB.
2. Implemented the faker bot.
3. Active storage implemented.
4. Views,controller and model.
5. Some queries.
